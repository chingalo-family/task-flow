	<!-- Disable app sandbox to allow ObjectBox native code to create database files.
	     ObjectBox currently has limitations with macOS sandboxing that prevent it from
	     creating lock files and memory-mapped database files properly.
	     
	     IMPORTANT: If you plan to distribute this app through the Mac App Store,
	     you MUST re-enable sandboxing and implement an alternative database solution
	     or use ObjectBox's sandbox-compatible configuration when available.
	     
	     For direct distribution outside the App Store, this configuration works fine.
